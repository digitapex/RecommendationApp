Before then they tried many different styles, and many different band-members, but with frustratingly similar results - widespread apathy. One exception was Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who granted Pulp a number of live radio sessions - again though, very little caught the public imagination. Eventually signing to Island in the early 90s, it was their major-label debut His 'n' Hers in 1994 that finally saw Pulp breaking into public consciousness. In Cocker they had an enigmatic singer and a sharp, witty lyricist: and new wave pop singles like \"Lipgloss\" and \"Do You Remember The First Time?\" were anthemic enough to break the UK charts.

This entertaining documentary traces the golden years of pulps, beginning in the 1920's, by highlighting numerous writers including Erle Stanley Gardner and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Popular and prolific authors Ray Bradbury and Frederik Pohl recall the days of nominal pay, short deadlines, and the insatiable demand for copy. Special coverage is given to the original cover art that defined pulp, featuring beautiful women, space creatures and blazing weapons.",
